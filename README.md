# DiscreteFourierTransform
Draw something. Then it runs the discrete fourier transform on the points and creates spinning arrows that drawout the image.

## How it works
Takes in the points drawn and converts them to points on the complex plane. then it feeds them into the discrete fourier transorm which is effectively the sum of lots of complex exponents.
The magnitude,phase and frequency can be determined from this complex output
